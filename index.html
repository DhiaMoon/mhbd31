        <div class="message" id="hiddenMessage">Happy Birthday Tita! I hope you enjoy your day and well of course, many more to come. You may or may not have heard of me but I have heard of you a lot from your children. They sing your praises and the fact that they do is already enough to show who you are- or perhaps more than a tip of the iceberg. I've heard of your kindness and your good personality. We interacted once or twice as well and although I may have been shy, I felt nothing negative from you. You radiate beauty, elegance, and power. You have simplicity and yet manage to radiate complexity and style. It's not just about the clothes I talk about, your demeanor as well. I don't mean to flatter, just my observations. Perhaps it's amazement I feel towards you- a beautiful wise woman of elegance. May God bless you with more days- years to come as you give light to those around you. </div>
